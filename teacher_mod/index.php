						eLearning refers to the use of electronic technologies to access educational curriculum beyond
						the traditional classroom setting. Various terms such as Distance Education, computerized
						electronic learning, online learning, and internet learning are used interchangeably to describe
						this form of education. In our definition, eLearning comprises courses specifically delivered
						via the internet, reaching learners outside the physical classroom where the instructor is
						present.
						Interactive by nature, eLearning allows communication with teachers, professors, or fellow
						students. It offers real-time engagement, allowing participants to electronically participate,
						ask questions, and interact during live sessions. Additionally, content delivery may include
						prerecorded lectures. Throughout the learning experience, a teacher or professor remains
						actively involved, providing feedback on participation, assignments, and assessments.
